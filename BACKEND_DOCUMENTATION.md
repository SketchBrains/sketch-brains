---

## Database Migrations

All migrations are stored in `supabase/migrations/` directory:

1. `001_add_payment_transactions.sql` - Payment tracking
2. `002_add_attendance_tracking.sql` - Session attendance
3. `003_add_certificates.sql` - Certificate management
4. `004_add_notifications.sql` - Notification system
5. `005_add_analytics.sql` - Analytics and logging
6. `006_add_session_recordings.sql` - Recordings and waitlist

**To apply migrations:**
Apply these migrations through Supabase dashboard or CLI when database is accessible.

---

## Recommended Cron Jobs

Set up these scheduled tasks for automation:

1. **process-referrals** - Every 15 minutes
2. **send-notifications** - Every 5 minutes
3. **update-event-status** - Daily at midnight (checks dates and updates event status)
4. **payment-reconciliation** - Daily at 2 AM (matches Razorpay settlements)
5. **generate-certificates** - Hourly (auto-generates for completed events)

---

## Integration Guidelines

### Razorpay Setup

1. Configure webhook URL in Razorpay dashboard: `https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/razorpay-webhook`
2. Enable events: `payment.authorized`, `payment.captured`, `payment.failed`
3. Save webhook secret for signature verification

### Email Service (SendGrid/AWS SES)

Configure in `send-notifications` function:
- API key in environment variables
- From email address
- Email templates

### SMS Service (Twilio)

Configure in `send-notifications` function:
- Account SID and Auth Token
- From phone number
- Message templates

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Payment success rate (target: >95%)
- Webhook processing time (target: <2 seconds)
- Notification delivery rate (target: >98%)
- Certificate generation success (target: 100%)
- Database query performance

### Logs Location

- Edge Function logs: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions
- Database logs: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Logs
- Webhook logs: `webhook_logs` table
- Admin actions: `admin_audit_logs` table

---

## Performance Optimization

- All foreign keys have indexes
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns
- JSONB indexes on metadata fields where needed
- Connection pooling enabled
- Query result caching for analytics

---

## Backup and Recovery

- Automated daily backups by Supabase
- Point-in-time recovery available
- Critical tables: `payment_transactions`, `registrations`, `certificates`
- Regular backup testing recommended

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Push notifications via FCM/APNs
- Advanced analytics with machine learning
- Multi-currency support
- Installment payment plans
- Video streaming integration (WebRTC/Agora)
- Mobile app with deep linking
- Social media integration
- Automated marketing campaigns

---

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Webhook not processing:**
- Check Razorpay webhook configuration
- Verify CORS headers
- Check webhook_logs table for errors

**Notifications not sending:**
- Verify email/SMS service credentials
- Check notification_preferences table
- Review notifications_queue for failed items

**Certificate generation failing:**
- Verify event status is "completed"
- Check payment status is "completed" or "free"
- Review generate-certificate function logs
